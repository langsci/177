This LaTeX2e package provides a command to typeset letters with the
ogonek diacritic mark; they are used in Polish and Lithuanian. The
command is named \k in accordance with the \k command available in
LaTeX2e for T1 encoding and DC fonts; however, it can be used also
with other font encodings, especially OT1 and CM fonts. For Polish
the best results are obtained with the special Polish PL fonts.
