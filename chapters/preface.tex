\chapter{前言}

本书是在我的德语书\emph{Grammatiktheorie}\citep{MuellerGTBuch2}的基础上进行扩展与修订的版本。它介绍了在当代理论学界发挥了重要作用，或者在过去做出了重要贡献的如今仍是主流的几种不同的语法理论。我对一些基础的假设进行了解释，并将这些不同的理论应用到德语的所谓“核心语法”之中。我决定采用在本书的德语版本中使用的目标语言，因为很多要处理的现象不能用英语当作目标语言来解释。而且，研究者已经开发了许多英语的理论，因为他们的母语是英语，并且应用这些理论到其他语言之中是很有启发性的。我将展示这些理论是如何处理论元、说明语、主动/被动转换，局部重新排序（所谓的置换）、动词位置以及长距离的短语前置（除了英语的日耳曼语族的语言中动词位于第二位的属性）这些现象的。
%This book is an extended and revised version of my German book \emph{Grammatiktheorie}
%\citep{MuellerGTBuch2}. It introduces various grammatical theories that play a role in current
%theorizing or have made contributions in the past which are still relevant today. I explain some foundational
%assumptions and then apply the respective theories to what can be called the ``core grammar'' of
%German. I have decided to stick to the object language that I used in the German version of this
%book since many of the phenomena that will be dealt with cannot be explained with English as the object
%language. Furthermore, many theories have been developed by researchers with English as their native
%language and it is illuminative to see these theories applied to another language.
%I show how the theories under consideration deal with arguments and adjuncts, active/passive
%alternations, local reorderings (so"=called scrambling), verb position, and fronting of phrases over
%larger distances (the verb second property of the Germanic languages without English).

The second part deals with foundational questions that are important for developing theories.
This includes a discussion of the question of whether we have innate domain specific knowledge of
language (UG), the discussion of psycholinguistic evidence concerning the processing of language by
humans, a discussion of the status of empty elements and of the question whether we construct and perceive utterances 
holistically or rather compositionally, that is, whether we use phrasal or lexical constructions.

Unfortunately, linguistics is a scientific field 
with a considerable amount of terminological chaos. I therefore wrote an introductory
chapter that introduces terminology in the way it is used later on in the book. The second chapter
introduces phrase structure grammars, which plays a role for many of the theories that are covered
in this book. I use these two chapters (excluding the Section~\ref{sec-PSG-Semantik} on interleaving
phrase structure grammars and semantics) in introductory courses of our BA curriculum for German
studies. Advanced readers may skip these introductory chapters. The following chapters are
structured in a way that should make it possible to understand the introduction of the theories
without any prior knowledge. The sections regarding new developments and classification are more
ambitious: they refer to chapters still to come and also point to other publications that are
relevant in the current theoretical discussion but cannot be repeated or summarized in this
book. These parts of the book address advanced students and researchers. I use this book for teaching
the syntactic aspects of the theories in a seminar for advanced students in our BA. The slides are
available on my web page. The second part of the book, the general discussion, is more ambitious and contains the discussion
of advanced topics and current research literature.

This book only deals with relatively recent developments. For a historical overview, see for instance
\citew{Robins97a-u,JL2006a-u}. I am aware of the fact that chapters on
Integrational Linguistics\is{Integrational Linguistics}
\citep{Lieb83a-u,Eisenberg2004a,Nolda2007a-u}, Optimality Theory\indexot (\citealp{PS93a-u};
\citealp{Grimshaw97a-u}; G.\ \citealp{GMueller2000a-u}), Role and Reference Grammar\is{Role and
  Reference Grammar} \citep{vanValin93a-ed} and Relational Grammar\is{Relational Grammar}
\citep{Perlmutter83a-ed,Perlmutter84b-ed} are missing. I will leave these theories for later editions.

The original German book was planned to have 400 pages, but it finally was much bigger: the first
German edition has 525 pages and the second German edition has 564 pages. I
added a chapter on Dependency Grammar and one on Minimalism to the English version and now the
book has \pageref{LastPage} pages. I tried to represent the chosen theories appropriately and to cite all important work. Although the list of
references is over 85 pages long, I was probably not successful.
I apologize for this and any other shortcomings.
